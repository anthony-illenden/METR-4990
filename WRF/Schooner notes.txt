Getting WRF running on Schooner:

To list available modules that were compiled by OSCER staff:
	module avail

For compiling WRF/WPS & loading in job submission (currently, but make sure to use
consistent versions when compiling and submitting jobs):
	module load JasPer/1.900.1-intel-2016a
	module load netCDF-Fortran/4.4.4-intel-2016a

	export NETCDF=/opt/oscer/software/netCDF-Fortran/4.4.4-intel-2016a
	export WRF_EM_CORE='1'
	export WRFIO_NCD_LARGE_FILE_SUPPORT='1'

or

	setenv NETCDF /opt/oscer/software/netCDF-Fortran/4.4.4-intel-2016a
	setenv WRF_EM_CORE 1
	setenv WRFIO_NCD_LARGE_FILE_SUPPORT 1

Compile WRF and WPS as normal with Intel option (15). Examples:
	./compile em_quarter_ss >& compile.log
	./compile em_real >& compile.log
