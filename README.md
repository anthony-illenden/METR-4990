Special research project with Dr. Stacey Hitchcock that investigated lake crossing MCSs to determine if the marine stable layer influences the persistence or dissipiation of the MCS. We analyzed the downstream synoptic/mesoscale environment (in conjuction with previous literature, see Metz 2011) and the interaction between the cold pool and marine stable layer. For the 7/19/2019 derecho we determined that the synoptic/mesoscale environment was quite similar to Johns (1993) warm-season progressive derecho and the environment over the lake was favorable for a possible MCS survival (according to the persistence/dissipation checklist provided by Justin Arnott). Following the collision between the cold pool and marine stable layer, the cold pool strengthened as evidenced by higher magnitude potential and equivalent potential temperature perturbations, and increased in depth from 1000-1500 meters to 2000-3000 meters.
