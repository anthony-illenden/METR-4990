Special research project with Dr. Stacey Hitchcock that investigated lake crossing MCSs to determine if the marine stable layer influences the persistence or dissipiation of the MCS. We analyzed the downstream synoptic/mesoscale environment (in conjuction with previous literature, see Metz 2011) and the interaction between the cold pool and marine stable layer.
